# MongoDB Docker Setup

This repository contains a Docker setup for running a MongoDB instance. It uses an official MongoDB Docker image as a base and provides a simple initialization script for setting up users and databases.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine. You can download Docker from [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

## Build and run Docker container


    Build the Docker image:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --d
    ```


 # Install project dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

# Run the Node.js server:

    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

Now, your Node.js project is set up to interact with the MongoDB database running in a Docker container.
